# Business Understanding
Seoul, South Korea is one of the most polluted cities in the developed world, ranking [3rd](https://www.ft.com/content/b49a9878-141b-11e7-80f4-13e067d5072c) highest daily average as of 2017. Additionally, Seoul has reached PM2.5 levels which is [two times](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/air-quality-seoul-pollution/) the annual limit that the WHO recommends. This project analyses a series of time series models to provide insight to the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, which is responsible for public health, to pinpoint what areas have the worst PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 levels that can lead to detrimental long term health effects to citizens across all districts of Seoul.
